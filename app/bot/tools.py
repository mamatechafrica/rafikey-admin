    Search for healthcare facilities in Kenya from the hospital referrals directory.
    
    This tool searches based on:
    - Location: County, Constituency, Sub County, or Ward (now supports explicit narrowing by each level)
    - Facility Name: Hospital or clinic name
    - Facility Type: Type of healthcare facility
    - KEPH Level: Kenya Essential Package for Health level (1-6)
    - Owner: Public, private, or NGO facilities

    You can specify any combination of county, sub_county, constituency, and ward for precise location-based filtering. If multiple are provided, the search will be narrowed to the most specific level.

    Args:
        location: (Optional) General location name (for backward compatibility)
        county: (Optional) County name
        sub_county: (Optional) Sub county name
        constituency: (Optional) Constituency name
        ward: (Optional) Ward name
        facility_name: Name of the healthcare facility
        facility_type: Type of facility (hospital, clinic, dispensary, etc.)
        keph_level: KEPH level classification (1-6)
        owner: Facility ownership type
        limit: Maximum number of results (default 10)

    Returns:
        Formatted list of healthcare facilities with details
